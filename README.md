# Bugger Arcade Game

## How to Run

To run the game, open [index.html](Udacity-ArcadeGame/index.html) in your web browser of choice.

## How to Play

Navigate your player using the **directional arrows** (up, down, left, and right).

Your objective is to **reach the water** on the opposite side of the stones, but
beware: colliding with the creepy, crawly insects will restart your player in
his original position.

The *grass is a safe zone* without bugs.

*Good luck!*
